        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. </li>
          <li>The title element defines the title of the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with the website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS is the acronym for Cascade Styling Sheets.</li>
        <li>It determines how the building blocks, as laid by HTML, are decorated and presented to the user.</li>
        <li>CSS is used to design the foundation laid by html. </li>
        <li>It’s used for background colour, styling, layout, borders, shadowing – all the essential design bits and bobs that make a webpage look slick and smart.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
       <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub</li>
       <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
       <li>Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
     </ul>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>JavaScript (JS),handles logic and allow users to interact with a website.</li>
       <li>Whether it's filling out forms, scrolling through maps, or registering for an event, it's most likely that JavaScript is what's allowing you to do it.</li>
       <li>Using a human form metaphor, HTML is what gives a skeleton to all of our features. It supports the head and the body of a person. </li>
       <li>CSS is what gives us our style, or our features, like the colour of our skin, eyes and hair. </li>
       <li>JavaScript is to do with our movements and how we interact with others – like when we reciprocate a handshake, wink, laugh or ask a question.</li>
     </ul>
